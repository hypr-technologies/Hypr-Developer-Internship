## ✍️ HyprDevlings Content Intern Competition – Project Outline

### 🎯 Objective

Give content interns ownership over storytelling, marketing, and product education around each template being built — while testing their ability to work cross-functionally with dev Pods, create standout content, and publish polished deliverables.

### 🧠 Core Mission

Each content intern will be embedded with a Pod and compete to create the **best documentation, landing page copy, tutorials, videos, and storytelling** around their Pod's templates.

---

### 📦 Team Pairings

* **1 Content Intern per Pod (5 total)**
* Each intern becomes the “content PM” for their Pod
* Paired with: UX/PM intern + Pod Lead for weekly alignment

---

### 🛠️ Content Deliverables per Template (per Sprint)

1. 📰 **Landing Page Copy** (hero headline, subheading, CTA)
2. 📘 **User Guide / Documentation** (Markdown or Notion-based)
3. 🎥 **Loom Walkthrough** or tutorial (2–5 mins, async demo)
4. 🖼️ **Promo Assets** (screenshots, mockups, badges, short social graphic or meme)
5. 🧩 **Component Copy** (onboarding text, form descriptions, labels, etc.)

---

### ⚡ Competition Theme: “**Make it Real**”

Judged on:

* ✨ Clarity – Can a real user understand this tool fast?
* 🎨 Style – Brand tone, microcopy, personality, memes?
* 💡 Creativity – Any surprises, animations, gifs, or clever interactions?
* 🎯 Fit – Does the content match the template’s audience?
* 💼 Documentation – Can someone use this tool with zero dev context?

# 🚀 HyprDevlings: The Intern Engine of Hypr.tech

Welcome to **HyprDevlings**, the mission-critical intern division of [Hypr.tech](https://hypr.tech) — a strategically small startup factory that deploys real projects, with real impact, for real users.

This isn't a sandbox. It's a launchpad.  
If you're reading this, you're either building with us, or about to.

## 🎯 Mission: Launch 25 Real-World Web Templates

We’re assembling 5 cross-functional Pods, each shipping **production-ready small business templates** every 2–3 weeks. The goal: **25 full-stack, themed web apps** in 10–12 weeks.

Interns here aren't observers — they're **owners** of code, copy, infra, and everything in between.

## 🧩 Pod Structure

Each Pod = 5 Interns → 1 Real-World Product Track  
All Pods follow agile sprints and build with autonomy.
