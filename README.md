# 🚀 HyprDevlings: The Intern Engine of Hypr.tech

Welcome to **HyprDevlings**, the mission-critical intern division of [Hypr.tech](https://hypr.tech) — a strategically small startup factory that deploys real projects, with real impact, for real users.

This isn't a sandbox. It's a launchpad.  
If you're reading this, you're either building with us, or about to.

## 🎯 Mission: Launch 25 Real-World Web Templates

We’re assembling 5 cross-functional Pods, each shipping **production-ready small business templates** every 2–3 weeks. The goal: **25 full-stack, themed web apps** in 10–12 weeks.

Interns here aren't observers — they're **owners** of code, copy, infra, and everything in between.

## 🧩 Pod Structure

Each Pod = 5 Interns → 1 Real-World Product Track  
All Pods follow agile sprints and build with autonomy.
