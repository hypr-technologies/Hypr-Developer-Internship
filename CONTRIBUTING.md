# ✍️ HyprDevlings Content Intern Competition – Project Outline

## 🎯 Objective

Give content interns ownership over storytelling, marketing, and product education around each template being built — while testing their ability to work cross-functionally with dev Pods, create standout content, and publish polished deliverables.

### 🧠 Core Mission

Each content intern will be embedded with a Pod and compete to create the **best documentation, landing page copy, tutorials, videos, and storytelling** around their Pod's templates.

---

### 📦 Team Pairings

* **1 Content Intern per Pod (5 total)**
* Each intern becomes the “content PM” for their Pod
* Paired with: UX/PM intern + Pod Lead for weekly alignment

---

### 🛠️ Content Deliverables per Template (per Sprint)

1. 📰 **Landing Page Copy** (hero headline, subheading, CTA)
2. 📘 **User Guide / Documentation** (Markdown or Notion-based)
3. 🎥 **Loom Walkthrough** or tutorial (2–5 mins, async demo)
4. 🖼️ **Promo Assets** (screenshots, mockups, badges, short social graphic or meme)
5. 🧩 **Component Copy** (onboarding text, form descriptions, labels, etc.)

### ⚡ Competition Theme: “**Make it Real**”

Judged on:
* ✨ Clarity – Can a real user understand this tool fast?
* 🎨 Style – Brand tone, microcopy, personality, memes?
* 💡 Creativity – Any surprises, animations, gifs, or clever interactions?
* 🎯 Fit – Does the content match the template’s audience?
