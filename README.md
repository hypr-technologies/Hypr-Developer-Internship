# 🚀 HyprDevlings: The Intern Engine of Hypr.tech

> **Welcome to HyprDevlings, the mission-critical intern division of Hypr.tech — a strategically small startup factory that deploys real projects, with real impact, for real users.**

**This isn't a sandbox. It's a launchpad.**  
If you're reading this, you're either building with us, or about to.

## 🎯 Mission: Launch 25 Real-World Web Templates

We're assembling **5 cross-functional Pods**, each shipping production-ready small business templates every 2–3 weeks. The goal: **25 full-stack, themed web apps in 10–12 weeks**.

Interns here aren't observers — they're **owners** of code, copy, infra, and everything in between.

## 🧩 Pod Structure

**Each Pod = 5 Interns → 1 Real-World Product Track**  
All Pods follow agile sprints and build with autonomy.

| 🧠 **Pod Lead** | Keeps velocity up, manages comms & planning |
| 🎨 **Frontend Dev** | React, Tailwind, animation, component design |
| ⚙️ **Backend Dev** | APIs, DBs, auth, logic layers |
| 🛠️ **DevOps / Infra** | Docker, CI/CD, deployment to hypr.tech servers |
| 🧪 **UX / PM Hybrid** | Docs, QA, user testing, Notion + comms hub |

## 🔁 Sprint Workflow (Every 2 Weeks)

**Plan & Design** → **Build & Test** → **Demo & Deploy**

Each Pod ships:
- ✅ Reusable frontend (React + Tailwind)
- ✅ Dockerized backend
- ✅ Full template docs (Markdown + Loom)
- ✅ Live demo: `https://template.hypr.tech`

## 🧠 Intern Growth Paths

Interns are ranked through performance, code reviews, and leadership:

| Rank | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧑‍🚀 **Hypr Cadet** | Just landed. Learning the ropes. |
| 🛠️ **Hypr Builder** | Contributing meaningful full-stack code |
| ⚙️ **Hypr Operator** | Leading features or deployments |
